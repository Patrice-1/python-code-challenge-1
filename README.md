# Python Fundamentals

An evaluation test on the understanding of basic python concepts covered.

## Set up and Running the application

### Prerequisites

-Python or Python3 and any text editor preferably Visual Studio



### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

-Fork this repo on your github account and copy the SSH key.
-Open your terminal by running the command _ctrl + alt + T_ and navigate to the directory you want to clone your repo in on your PC.
-Run _git clone git@github.com:Patrice-1/python-code-challenge-1.git_ to create a remote copy of the code on your PC.

2. **Navigate to the cloned directory**
-Run _cd python-code-challenge-1_ to navigate to the cloned directory.
-Run _ls_ to confirm the directory has been cloned successfully.
-Run _code ._ whilst still in the directory on the terminal to open it on VSCode.

3. Run Python Code
-You can run the script directly to test the functions and class implementations on the VSCode terminal.
-Run _python3 <script_name>_ to run the script if you have both python2 and python3 installed on your system. Replace <script_name> with the actual script name where you have implemented the code. Example, _python3 car.py_.
-You can also run the code on the python interpreter by running _python <script_name>_ on the terminal.
-You can also add the **code runner* extension to your VSCode and use it to run your code.

4. Saving progress for changes made
-If you have made any changes to the code, you can save them by running _git add ._
-Then run _git commit -m "commit message"_ to save the changes.
-Run _git push_ to push the changes to your main repository on github.
